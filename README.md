```swift
// Use RestBird without any driver
targets: [
    Target(name: "YourTarget", dependencies: ["RestBird"])
]

// Use the URLSession Driver
targets: [
    Target(name: "YourTarget", dependencies: [
        .product(name: "RestBird-URLSession", package: "RestBird")
    ])
]

// Use the Alamofire Driver
targets: [
    Target(name: "YourTarget", dependencies: [
        .product(name: "RestBird-Alamofire", package: "RestBird")
    ])
]
